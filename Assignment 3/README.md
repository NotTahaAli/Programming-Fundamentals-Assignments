# Problem 1:
Write a C++ code to produce the following output: [10]
```
                1
            1       1
        1       2       1
    1       3       3       1
1       4       6       4       1
```
# Problem 2:
Write a program to print all prime numbers from 1 to 300. [10]

A Prime Number can be divided evenly only by 1 or itself. And it must be greater than 1.

*Hint: Use nested loops, break and/or continue*
# Problem 3:
Write a program to fill the entire screen with a smiling face. The smiling face has an ASCII value 1. [10]

For this task you should know the height and width of your screen.

# Problem 4:
Write a program to generate all combinations of 1, 2 and 3 using for loop [10]

Sample Output:
```
111
112
113
...
...
```

#  Problem 5:
The natural logarithm can be approximated by the following series. [10]

$$\frac{x-1}{x}+\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-1}{x})^2+\frac{1}{3}(\frac{x-1}{x})^3+\frac{1}{4}(\frac{x-1}{x})^4+...$$

If x is input through the keyboard, write a program to calculate the sum of first seven terms of this series

# Problem 6:
Write a C++ code to produce the following output: [10]
```
A B C D E F G F E D C B A
A B C D E F   F E D C B A
A B C D E       E D C B A
A B C D           D C B A
A B C               C B A
A B                   B A
A                       A
```

# Problem 7:
Write a program to add first seven terms of the following series using for loop(s) [10]

$$ \frac{1}{1!}+\frac{2}{2!}+\frac{3}{3!} + ...$$

# Problem 8: 
Take a positive input from the user and store in n. Produce an iterative sequence using 
the formula given below [10]

n = n/2 (if n is even)

n = 3n + 1 (if n is odd).

The program should print out the chain for the number n up till 1s. The length of each chain should be printed at the end of the chain.

Sample Input : `13`

Sample Output: 
```
13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 ; length = 10
```

# Problem 9:
You have to create a simple tic-tac-toe game with the help of for loop and if statements 
Do not use any built-in function, Array and any other loop only use for loop and if statement. [20]
